Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000. Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index.
